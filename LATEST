[02/03] Fixes. Add to wanted option to specify a custom title
[********** COMMIT **********]
[22/02] Add track show.
When begin this project i have some basic/main features in mind that i want to implement. This is the last one.
Next weeks i try not add to much new things for avoid introduce more bugs) and fix bugs and some internal 
improvement/changes (have a lot of work). If you found bugs/problems please report.
How works: Its simple, under the show view you have now a button for track show, you choose the episode to begin track,
can be the first one, the last one or any other and "track show" will search from this chapter and forward, jumping already have
episodes and added to wanted list the missing and new ones, default 1 (configurable), when download is complete will add the next.
On Wanted section, will appear the tracked show in the bottom with same options that other wanted, but that options are indiferent
for "track show", that options are the options that will inherit the episode when added to the download/track list. That mean
if you configure the "track show" for check Sunday, "track show" will add anytime the chapter with "Sunday" configure as a check
day.
Warning: Track show by default add one chapter, if this get stuck (no peers) or is missing not will add more, you need change to two
or more in general wanted configuration.

[13/02] Added Global search Tags for Wanted
        Rewrite partially Global tags, configuration is located under Configuration/Wanted and are relative only to wanted and how will search.
and this values affect globally to all wanted searchs.
        These are:
        "Global Quality" (old), no change, when trackerm search for a wanted item get the preferer quality 
or ANY if is set and  not found a specific quality (order matters).
        "Global Ignore Keywords" (old). Without changes too. If found any of this keywords in the title will not download
        "Global Require Keywords" (new). Title must have ALL the keywords if not, not will download (caution).
        "Global Require OR" (new). Title must have at least ONE of this keywords. if not, not will download. Usefull (perhaps) 
for languages match like force only download files that have in the title the words ENGLISH or ENG.  SPANISH or ESPAÃ‘OL or CASTELLANO.
Remeber: if you set this, at least one keyword need match in the title for download.
[13/02] DROP the option for language tagging, you can use "Extra Keywords" for add languages tags or  "Global Require OR" if you want 'wanted items' with
any of selected  language keywords in the title (or both).
[13/02] Fixed: "Tag Extra Keywords" (in main configuration).  trackerm will search these keywords in the title and tag (this config option not affect 
searchs just tag). Beware: if you have a temporaly linked avi and add/remove a keyword. This will create another valid link again and appears as 
duplicate when scanning. (when move will delete this link)
